#### Overview
In the programming language of your choice, simulate the experience of a dayâ€™s business at a bank. Your implementation must make use of a min-heap, and must fit the following criterion:

#### Criteria
1. At program launch, it will query the user for the number of tellers working that day. There must be at least four tellers, and no more than ten tellers. If a number is passed in outside of those bounds, have your program round up to four or down to ten as appropriate for the input. Your tellers will be represented by the min-heap of a size equal to the number of tellers.
2. To start the simulation generate 100-200 customers randomly, and place them in a queue. Each customer will have a total service time that it will take to conclude their business.
3. Dequeue customers from the queue into your min-heap until it is full. The customer service time is the metric which will be used to balance the heap.
4. Pop the top customer off of your heap, and decrement the service time for all customers remaining in the heap. If a customer which is still in the heap has their service time reach 0 in this process, remove that customer from the heap. 
5. Populate the heap back to maximum capacity through dequeueing from your queue
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until both the heap and queue are empty.
7. Every 20 customers that pass out of the queue, print the current status of the queue (how many customers are left), and print the current composition of the heap.

#### Solution
My solution uses javascript, and I had to write a MinHeap and Queue from scratch. They seem to work correctly. The Bank class connects the customer queue and the teller minheap, and handles queueing/dequeueing customers and processing their service times. Reporting is done by dumping the queue and minheap states into a reporter function that then barfs out a bunch of html.

This solution should work in any modern web browser (and some not-so-modern). Just open index.html in your favorite browser, click `Randomize` as much as you like or manually set your values. Once you're satisfied, click `Simulate` and watch the magic!

`classes.js` contains the meat of the program, including my implementations of Queue and MinHeap, as well as the Bank class. `runtime.js` contains the runtime code, including event bindings for buttons in the html, as well as the actual operation of the bank class. 

Here is a link to the solution on codepen in case these bundled files don't work for some stupid reason. [http://codepen.io/DSurguy/pen/ZLXbar](http://codepen.io/DSurguy/pen/ZLXbar)
